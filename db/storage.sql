-- Avatar storage bucket + policies. Run once via the Supabase SQL editor,
-- after `npm run push` and `rls.sql`.
-- Public bucket (avatar URLs are just displayed as <img src>, nothing sensitive),
-- but uploads/overwrites/deletes are restricted to the owner's own folder
-- (objects are stored as "<user id>/<filename>").
